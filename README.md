### MaskGANs

This project is a collaboration between Dillon Quan and Shrikar Thodla to train a MaskGans model to genereate text. This project was inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07736). The goal of this project is to train this model to develop an understanding on GANs, GANs for text, and how to further our Pytorch knowledge.
